    A <b>Gradle plugin</b> that generates Intellij Run configurations from a YAML definition file, written in <a href="https://kotlinlang.org">Kotlin</a>.
</p>

## üí° Introduction

This plugin allows to specify [Intellij Run configurations](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration.html) with YAML!

For now, the scope of the plugin is quite simplistic, but over time new use cases or improvements may be added!

Originally, this plugin was developed for our Besu plugin: [Exflo](https://github.com/41north/exflo) as a way of sharing complex configurations easily.

## üôà Usage

To apply the plugin, use the gradle plugin syntax:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("dev.north.fortyone.intellij.run.generator") version "0.2.0"
}
```

Once the plugin is applied, you can configure it with the following options (default values are displayed below):

```kotlin
intellijRunGenerator {
  tasksDefinitionsFile.set(File("./intellij-run-configs.yaml"))
  tasksDefinitionsFileExtension = FilenameFilter { _, name -> name.toLowerCase().endsWith(".yaml") || name.toLowerCase().endsWith(".yml") }
  tasksDefinitionOutputDir.set(File(".idea/runConfigurations"))
}
```

Also you can specify a folder instead of a single definition file, just like this (by default it will load all `*.yaml`, `*.yml` files):

```kotlin
intellijRunGenerator {
  tasksDefinitionsFile.set(File("./intellij-run-configs/"))
}
```

If you want to see how the definition file looks like, there're some examples inside [`samples/intellij-run-configs.yaml`](samples/intellij-run-configs.yaml).
