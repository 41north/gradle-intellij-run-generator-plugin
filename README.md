    A <b>Gradle plugin</b> that generates Intellij Run configurations from a YAML definition file, written in <a href="https://kotlinlang.org">Kotlin</a>.
</p>

## üí° Introduction

This plugin was developed originally for [Exflo](https://github.com/41north/exflo).

## üôà Usage

To apply the plugin, use the gradle plugin syntax:

```kotlin
plugins {
  id("dev.north.fortyone.intellij.run.generator") version "0.1.0"
}
```

Once the plugin is applied, you can configure it with the following options (default values are displayed below):

```kotlin
`intellij-run-generator` {
  tasksDefinitionsFile.set(File("./intellij-run-configs.yaml"))
  tasksDefinitionOutputDir.set(File(".idea/runConfigurations"))
}
```

If you want to see how the definition file looks like, there's one example taken from Exflo inside [`samples/intellij-run-configs.yaml`](samples/intellij-run-configs.yaml).
